# Habit Tracking Smart Ring Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a smart ring integrated with a React Native mobile application. The smart ring will feature an e-ink display to show user habits, while the mobile application will allow users to manage and track these habits.

## Project Roadmap

- **Conceptualization & Planning**: Define the core features and objectives of the smart ring and mobile application.
- **Component Acquisition**: Purchase necessary components for the smart ring prototype.
- **Breadboarding & Initial Testing**: Set up components on a breadboard for initial testing.
- **Firmware Development**: Develop firmware for the smart ring's microcontroller.
- **React Native App Development**: Build the mobile application using React Native with Bluetooth integration.
- **Integration**: Ensure seamless communication between the smart ring and the mobile application.
- **PCB Design & Assembly**: Design a custom PCB for the smart ring and solder components.
- **Testing & Iteration**: Test the complete system and make necessary refinements.
- **Miniaturization**: Reduce the size of the smart ring prototype to fit a ring form factor.
- **Final Deployment**: Launch the product for users.

## General Considerations

- **Size & Comfort**: The smart ring's size and comfort are paramount. Ensure components are miniaturized without compromising functionality.
- **Battery Life**: Optimize power consumption to maximize battery life, given the small form factor.
- **Durability**: The ring should be robust, waterproof, and able to withstand daily wear and tear.
- **User Experience**: Ensure the mobile application is user-friendly, intuitive, and provides value to the user.
- **Feedback Loop**: Regularly gather feedback from potential users and iterate based on their input.
- **Collaboration**: Consider collaborating with experts in areas where you might lack experience, such as electronics or native app development.

## Initial Setup

- **Environment Setup**: Install Node.js and React Native CLI.
  - `npm install -g react-native-cli`

- **Project Initialization**: Start a new React Native project.
  - `react-native init HabitApp`

## App Features & Components

- **Habit Management**: 
  - Allow users to create, edit, and delete habits.
- **Daily Tracking**: 
  - Users can mark habits as completed or not completed for each day.
- **History & Analytics**: 
  - Display a history of habit tracking and provide insights or analytics.
- **Ring Customization**: 
  - Allow users to customize the e-ink display on the ring, such as choosing icons or patterns.

## Bluetooth Integration

- **Library Installation**: 
  ```bash
  npm install --save react-native-ble-plx
- **Device Pairing**: 
  - Implement functionality to pair the app with the smart ring.
- **Data Transfer**: 
  - Ensure seamless data transfer between the app and the ring, such as sending customization settings or receiving sensor data (if applicable).

## User Interface & UX

- **Navigation**: 
  - Use `@react-navigation/native` for app navigation.
- **Styling**: 
  - Ensure a consistent and user-friendly design using libraries like `react-native-elements` or `native-base`.
- **Feedback**: 
  - Provide feedback to users, such as success messages, error messages, or loading indicators.

## Data Storage & Management

- **Local Storage**: 
  - Use `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for local data storage.
- **Cloud Integration (Optional)**: 
  - If syncing data across devices or cloud backup is desired, consider integrating Firebase Firestore or another cloud database.

## Testing & Debugging

- **Emulators & Real Devices**: 
  - Regularly test the app on both iOS and Android emulators and real devices.
- **Error Handling**: 
  - Implement robust error handling, especially for Bluetooth communication.
- **Performance**: 
  - Monitor app performance and optimize as necessary.

## Deployment

- **Building for Production**: 
  - Prepare the app for deployment by building it for production.
- **App Store & Google Play**: 
  - Submit the app to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, following their respective guidelines.
